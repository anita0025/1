HostArmada is a relatively new player in the hosting arena, but they've quickly gained recognition for their performance-oriented infrastructure and customer-focused approach, making them a great fit for a cyberpunk community.

### Cloud-Based Infrastructure:
HostArmada utilizes a cloud-based infrastructure, meaning your website is hosted across a network of servers instead of a single physical server.

In the event of a server failure, your website will automatically be migrated to another server in the network, minimizing downtime.

### SSD Storage and Fast Caching:

Their team of experts will handle the entire migration process for you, ensuring a seamless transition with minimal downtime. This is a valuable benefit, especially if you're not technically inclined.

### 24/7 Support:
