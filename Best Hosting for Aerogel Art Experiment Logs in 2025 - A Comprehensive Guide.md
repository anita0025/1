### Scalability:
As your aerogel art experiments grow and you accumulate more data, you will need a hosting solution that can scale with your needs. Scala Hosting's VPS plans offer a high degree of scalability. You can easily upgrade your resources, such as CPU, RAM, and storage, as needed, without having to migrate to a new server. This flexibility ensures that your website can handle increased traffic and data storage demands without any performance issues.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting offers a range of VPS plans to suit different needs and budgets. Their managed VPS plans start at around $14.95 per month, offering ample resources for hosting a website with detailed experiment logs.
